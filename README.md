# MSX_ShmupPathGenerator
A tool to to pre-calculate MSX shmup character and bullets paths. Originally developped for the game Legacy of Darkness, but it can be tweaked for other projets. Don't bother using it on a PV game, the cost for calculating a path in real time is not a lot for current processors.
